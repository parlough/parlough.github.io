    大家好。I'm Parker Lougheed and I am currently a student studying Computer Science and East Asian Studies
    at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, graduating this Spring 2020. I was born and raised in Minnesota,
    where I learned to love snow and the beauty of all four seasons. My dreams are large and numerous, my interests
    are varied and unique, my past is my bygone past, and my future is undecided. While this future of mine is
    undecided and hopefully full of many adventures, I hope that mine somehow intertwines with yours somewhere
    along the road.
</p>
<p class="main">
    While much of my time is taken up by class, my true passion lies in computer science education as well as
    programming languages and education technology. I have spent a long time learning computer science and taking
    classes of all subjects. During this time I had the greatest of teachers and had the best opportunities available,
    but often that was still not enough, especially in computer science. Now that I have learned my fair share,
    I would like to spread my love for the subject and be as great as the teachers I had to as many students as I
    possibly can while still building those deep connections I loved having with my teachers.
</p>
<p class="main">
    As a gift to you, I leave you with the the song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlQ-drhvT0c">"I am alive"
    by JJ Lin featuring Jason Mraz</a>. A beautiful piece by two magnificent artists that helps you realize that you
    "have all the strength" you need, and the most important thing is that you keep dreaming and keep trying.

                At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I currently work as the peer mentor for CS354, a class which
                acts as an introduction to computer systems. A lot is first introduced and taught to the students in
                this class, primarily the C language, x86 assembly, memory management, and debugging. The content gets
                rather deep and technical as an important step towards more advanced classes such as operating systems
                and compilers.
            </p>
            <p class="inside">
                My primary responsibilities have been creating programming assignments, the corresponding grading
                scripts and related videos, then providing assistance through Piazza, Email, Skype, and in person. I
                have rather enjoyed this as I have been able to explore the students knowledge and help them solidify it
                through interesting projects such as a connect 4 validator. My overall experience so far has been great
                and I look forward to continue this experience, helping create enriching experiences for the students
                and making sure they walk away from this course with enough knowledge to succeed in their careers and
                their future courses.

                At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in the fall of 2019 worked as a peer tutor
                for the Computer Science department in the
                <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/computer-sciences-learning-center-cslc/">
                    Computer Science Learning Center(CSLC)</a>. I started tutoring there for a class in the beginning
                of 2019 and continued until the end of 2019. I primarily tutored our school's three introductory Java
                courses, focusing on Object Orientated Programming, data structures, and basic algorithm analysis and
                implementation. Outside of that I have also tutored basic data science, computer engineering,
                computer organization courses, as well as more advanced classes like introduction to
                artificial intelligence and operating systems. Sometimes my job required me to make educational videos
                as well for the the introductory Java courses.

            <p class="inside">
                This job was not just a job for me the year, but rather a great passion. Even outside of my hired
                hours I came to help whenever needed and when I had time, as I enjoyed working with all of my fellow
                classmates, helping them build their own understanding and own passion for computer science. I hope to
                continue in similar positions and help more students find a love for computer science. It can be
                stressful in the beginning, especially when there is not too much help, but I know from experience
                having someone there to guide you is a fantastic experience. I made many friends there and I hope
                they all will pass on what they have learned to others as well.

                At <a href="https://www.idtech.com/">iD Tech Camps</a>, I worked as the lead instructor at the
                UW-Madison location. Like other instructors, I taught a new group of students, aged 7-17 each week in
                varying topics, including Cybersecurity and Encryption, Machine Learning, Minecraft Modding, Coding and
                Engineering, and more. I got to work with the students throughout the week teaching them the various
                concepts from coding concepts like for loops, to mathematical concepts like binary arithmetic and
                ciphers, other advanced concepts such as activation functions in neural networks, and much more. Beyond
                teaching and helping the students build their final projects each week, as an instructor I also lead
                activities such as board games, video game tournaments, scavenger hunts, and others. Each week and each
                group of students was completely different from the last, it truly put my skills as an educator
                to the test and enabled me to grow in many unexpected ways.
            </p>
            <p class="inside">
                Beyond my duties as an instructor, I also took over many roles of the assistant director throughout
                the summer. This included educational roles, such as helping coordinate activities and general planning,
                as well as offering feedback and suggestions to other instructors. This also included administrative
                roles such as communicating with parents, handling checkin and checkout of students, being properly
                trained in multiple types of first aid, completing inventory each week, and more.

            <p class="inside">
                Overall, I had the time of life and loved every student I got to meet and work with throughout the
                summer. I hope I taught them a lot and helped them have fun, as I know they taught me a lot and provided
                me with an amazing time. I wish I could continue teaching them all as their computer science teacher
                in school. Each and every one of them is impossibly smart and continued to amaze me, I am just glad
                I had a chance to help all of them on their paths of reaching their maximum potential.

                My most important experience has of course been here at UW - Madison where I've been studying since
                the fall of 2017 and will graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science this spring
                of 2020. I also plan to complete an East Asian Studies Certificate, with a focus on Chinese language,

                While I have taken a lot of classes here from biology classes to digital studies to Chinese and of
                course to computer science, some have really stood out. I have especially enjoyed my Chinese classes and
                some of computer science classes. My favorite has been Computer Graphics (CS 559) as it was a relatively
                new concept to me and it was very exciting to create 3D graphics with movement and interaction with
                light and more. It was one class where you can really see the fruits of your labor and have some
                creativity with it. I also really liked Programming Language (CS 536) as well. While a lot of it was
                rather introductory, it was nice to have a more formal introduction to some of the concepts I had
                studied on my own previously.

                I spent my last two years of high school here. I ended up changing schools so I would have
                more opportunities in the form of AP and IB classes, so I could challenge myself and further my
                preparation for university. It was different from my original high school in a lot of ways, but I
                quickly adjusted and I found myself at home in this school's knowledge bowl, where I took up a
                leadership role, especially during my senior year. I also enjoyed a club called Backpack Tutoring,
                where we would go to an elementary school, and work with academically at risk students. It was quite
                fun to work with them and see them progress throughout the year, despite some of the challenges faced.
            </p>
            <p class="inside">
                The main reason I went to this school was the classes and a more challenging environment though. This
                new school only had 6 classes a day and I was in an odd position as I had completed different classes
                than other's, but for the most part I was able to find good classes to take. My two favorite were
                AP Computer Science and IB HL Computer Science as these allowed to me practice and expand my computer
                science and problem solving skills in a more formal environment where there is more pressure to stay
                on task. Both of these classes had fantastic teachers and I felt like they really helped me grow.
            </p>
            <p class="inside">
                Outside of computer science, I took plenty of other classes, such as AP Literature and Composition,
                which really brought me out of comfort zone in analyzing texts verbally and through writing. I also
                took classes like AP European History, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Biology, AP Statistics,
                AP Psychology, IB Literature and Performance, and other courses such as continuing Spanish and
                experimenting with video production. Overall, switching to this new school, brought me increased
                opportunity and provided me a more challenging environment which I appreciated greatly.

                I grew up in this school district and continued until the end of my 10th grade years. I
                had a lot of great experiences with both my friends and my teachers there. Some of my most memorable
                experiences were in Knowledge Bowl, an academic trivia competition club, and YES! club where we worked
                to make our school, our community, and our world a more environmentally place by doing data collection,
                research, trips to related areas, and planning and implementing our improvements. I also had great times
                in all of my classes, for example AP Chemistry, where we got to explore our investigative side deeply
                for the first time and AP Human Geography, where we got to expand our view of the world, its
                populations, and what it all means.
            </p>
            <p class="inside">
                Beyond that, I enjoyed my other classes and clubs such as Key Club, a volunteer organization, Math
                League, where we would compute in mathematics competitions, Science Club, which YES! club was a subset
                of, and Spanish where I got to practice my Spanish skills a little extra outside of class.

                I truly loved school, especially K-12. I love the connections you make with your classmates, with your
                teachers, with other school staff. The environment is so unique and it is such an important part of
                everyone's life. I loved it so much that one of my goals is one day being a high school computer science
                teacher myself, where I can build those connections, help students realize they matter, and that they
                can do anything they put their minds' to. While I loved it all, I do think there is a lot we can
                improve in the education world though, especially in computer science as it is still a relatively new
                field. So when I have the time I like to read about different methods of teaching computer science,
                why it is important, and more such as what Mark Guzdial's book covers:

                This one is kind of obvious as all I have been talking about is my interesting in computer science and
                computer science education, but I love programming. Everything about it is great, from the problem
                solving and API designing, to having something finally show up. I first got interested because of
                modifying games, but now my interests have expanded to creating tools to make software developer's jobs
                easier as well as the process of teaching and learning for teachers and students an even more fluid

                languages, especially virtual machines. I think they are just a quite interesting tool where a lot of
                research has been done and can still be done, to make performance better, improve safety, and along with
                new programming languages can introduce a lot of useful features for developers.

                lovely new introductions while still remaining within the JVM ecosystem. I've gotten comfortable with it
                over time and feel almost as proficient in it as with Java, outside of its more particular features
                which I have not had as much of a chance to use. I've started writing all of my Gradle build scripts in
                Kotlin rather than Groovy and my recent projects have been in Kotlin instead of Java. While I still
                love Java, I can now understand the benefits Kotlin brings to the table and am comfortable teaching
                people the language from scratch, or in transition from another JVM language.

                I've used Dart a fair share for learning and side projects. I've been following it with a lot of
                interest as I wanted to enter web development but didn't like JavaScript or TypeScript and Dart felt
                familiar to me, with a lot of great features. Since Flutter for cross platform apps was announced,
                my interest has only increased. Since then I've experimented a lot in the language and worked to build
                an understanding of its compiler and static analysis infrastructure as well as its virtual machine.

                like how to properly manage memory, even implementing my own malloc and free implementations. I have
                then expanded my knowledge in my operating systems course and then by becoming the peer mentor for
                the course which introduces C and its related concepts. While I haven't coded much C++,
                I have a little, and I'd feel comfortable picking it up if needed, especially with my C base.

                I'm still relatively new to web development, but I'm no stranger to JavaScript as I have had to use it
                for small personal projects in the past as well as in my computer graphics class where we used
                JavaScript along with different browser APIs such as WebGL to create all of our assignments. I most
                recently expanded my skills in a Software Development class where we made a social media website
                for teachers to use, utilizing Angular and TypeScript. It was been a fabulous experience and my
                understanding of web technologies really had a chance to flourish. A lot of my interest revolves around
                improvements/replacements for JavaScript, such as Dart and Web Assembly, so I also have researched
                a lot about the language and its various implementations/runtimes.

                Testing can be a pain, but I am a fairly cautious programmer, so I tend to always be thinking of things

                the problem I think could arise. I have experience with JUnit 4 and 5 as well as many manual testing
                setups. Most of my experience has come from working on SpongePowered projects and converting
                100s of tests from JUnit 4 to 5, but I have also utilized these testing methods in some of my
                computer science courses in university.

                adding, committing, pushing, and merging. They have also required me to continuously use more complicated
                functionality such as branching, which is quite important to work on many features at once with a lot
                of different people. I've also heavily used rebasing, resetting, and cherry-picking to support long term

                My first superficial experience with computer hardware started in middle school when I started
                researching how computer parts work and come together to bring a computer to a functional state. Once
                I eventually had the money to do so, I was able to apply this knowledge to properly understanding what
                I was buying when I designed my first computer and then built my second one.

            <p class="inside">
                My deeper experience with hardware came in university when I took two introduction electrical/computer
                engineering courses. They still took a pretty high level view, with the first focusing on binary,
                hexadecimal, finite state machines, assembly, and similar concepts. The second course then went more in
                depth where we built on that knowledge to understand how circuits and gates build logic and how
                features like serial execution and memory work at the circuitry level. We applied this knowledge to
                design circuits that we downloaded onto FPGAs to test our programs. This was still not that deep,
                but it has helped me understanding a lot more of how my programs can be implemented on actual circuits.

                As I've talked about, a lot of my interest lies in education, this includes education technology. At

                Schoology, Canvas, PowerSchool, TopHat, and many more. I think these all do an okay job at the moment,
                but can continue to do an even better job over time making the job of teacher's easier and improving the
                education students are experiencing. I have experience with many education technology tools from having
                used them, but also having researched them and their code if public, analyzing how we can improve these
                tools for our teachers and students. I have also been to an EdTechTeam summit where I learned about a
                a lot of other teals and got to network with people in the field, educators and companies.

                I have been developing my leadership skills ever since I was little, but the first time I put them to
                good use was when I would play multiplayer games when I was a teenager. I quickly started forming my
                own groups, guilds, factions, clans, etc. I got to experience leading multiple players through
                completing goals, coordinating attacks and defenses, distributing work, etc. It was a fun experience
                where I made a lot of friends and learned the importance of sharing feedback back and forth with those
                you're leading and to share responsibility with them. We faced many tough challenges, but together as
                a team we were always able to overcome them, not because of a single person's leadership. Rather because
                we all had something to contribute and I was just able to help create something cohesive out of that.

                Another leadership experience for me was in Knowledge Bowl at Minnetonka High School. While the club
                had teachers as advisers, there was a lack of student leaders and drive from the students to help
                the club reach its potential. I missed the feel of Knowledge Bowl at my old school so I tried to step
                up to help accomplish this. I got friends I made to join the club and I helped to learn during practices
                and sometimes I would give small tips or lessons to my classmates from my past experiences. I was not
                necessarily that skilled at Knowledge Bowl, but I'd like to think I helped from the drive and structure
                I helped provide. Senior year I took even more initiative as it wasn't my first year there anymore, and
                I handled initial recruiting, document creation and hanging up, communicating with the advisers, our
                chats. While Knowledge Bowl season is not too long, we had a fun time both years, and my two friends who
                took up co-president roles when I left did a fantastic job with the club. I got a chance to watch one
                of their meets this year and they've done a lot for the club and it was great to see all of them grow
                so much after two years.

                I also took on a staff role in the SpongePowered project, which is a development organization, which
                creates APIs, server software, and tools for Minecraft server owners and players to create plugins
                which can optionally bridge the gap between mods and plugins. I became a core developer when I started
                to contribute more to the project over time. Along with this I became a staff, where I helped be an
                example and plan our monthly events and moderate our forums as well as other communication platforms.
                Now I don't have as much time as I used to, but I still try to provide input when I have the time and
                capability. Here I learned to work with others on large projects and be an example in a community.

                in class, and I have loved every moment of it. At first it was slow moving, but I have been reaching a
                point where I am able to understand more from other's conversations, have basic conversations about
                quite a few topics, and understand more from the shows I watch without subtitles. I really do enjoy it
                and the other things I've learned along the way about China and Chinese culture, so I plan to stick
